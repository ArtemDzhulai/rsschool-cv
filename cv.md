3. I am a person who has tried a lot of professions, but none of them brought pleasure. I have experience in banking, security, police, a receptionist and a factory worker in a hot production. Finally I decided to try myself in IT industry. I am sure that such a long journey to the IT industry was not in vain.
4. ***Skills:*** I'm starting from scratch, but for self-development I took initial courses for beginners in HTML, CSS and JS.
5. **Code example**(*task to solve when registering on Codewars*):
const assert = require("chai").assert;

function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b;
};

describe("Multiply", () => {
  it("fixed tests", () => {
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(1,1), 1);
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(2,1), 2);
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(2,2), 4);
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(3,5), 15);   
  });
});
6. *No experience in the IT field yet.* 
7. 2 higher educations:
    - ZGIA, specialty "Enterprise Economics" (2009)
    - KPU, jurisprudence (2017)
Courses in Code Basics for beginners in HTML, CSS and JS.
8. A2 (*currently learning with Doulingo*).
