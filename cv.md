I am a person who has tried a lot of professions, but none of them brought pleasure. I have experience in banking, security, police, a receptionist and a factory worker in a hot production. Finally I decided to try myself in IT industry. I am sure that such a long journey to the IT industry was not in vain.

***Skills:*** I'm starting from scratch, but for self-development I took initial courses for beginners in HTML, CSS and JS.

**Code example**(*task to solve when registering on Codewars*):

```
const assert = require("chai").assert;


function multiply(a, b){


  return a * b;


};


describe("Multiply", () => {


  it("fixed tests", () => {


    assert.strictEqual(multiply(1,1), 1);


    assert.strictEqual(multiply(2,1), 2);


    assert.strictEqual(multiply(2,2), 4);


    assert.strictEqual(multiply(3,5), 15);


      });


});
```
*No experience in the IT field yet.*

2 higher educations:

- KPU, jurisprudence (2017)

Courses in Code Basics for beginners in HTML, CSS and JS.

A2 (*currently learning with Doulingo*).
